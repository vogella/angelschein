# Project Overview

This directory contains comprehensive study materials and documentation for the **German Fishing License (Angelschein/Fischereischein)**. It serves as a knowledge base covering the six mandatory subject areas required for the state fishing examination.

The content is organized into Markdown files, each dedicated to a specific field of study mandated by German fishery laws.

# Directory Structure & Key Files

The project is structured logically by subject matter:

*   **`00-Angelschein-Uebersicht.md`**: The central index and introduction. It outlines the examination structure (theory and practice) and provides a summary of all knowledge areas.
*   **`01-Allgemeine-Fischkunde.md`** (General Ichthyology): Covers fish anatomy, physiology, sensory organs, respiration, reproduction, diseases, and age determination.
*   **`02-Spezielle-Fischkunde.md`** (Special Ichthyology): Details specific freshwater fish species, identification characteristics, habitats, protected species, closed seasons, and size limits.
*   **`03-Gewaesserkunde.md`** (Hydrology/Limnology): Explains water body types (flowing vs. still), ecological zones, water quality, nutrient cycles, and the aquatic food web.
*   **`04-Natur-und-Tierschutz.md`** (Nature and Animal Protection): Focuses on ethical treatment of fish (waidgerechtigkeit), conservation laws, protected flora and fauna, and proper handling of catch.
*   **`05-Geraetekunde.md`** (Equipment Knowledge): Describes fishing tackle including rods, reels, lines, hooks, baits, and necessary accessories like landing nets.
*   **`06-Gesetzeskunde.md`** (Legal Knowledge): Covers federal and state fishery laws, permits, prohibitions, penalties, and the role of fishery supervision.

# Usage

This project is a **non-code documentation repository**.

*   **Study Guide:** The primary use is for personal study or teaching preparation for the theoretical and practical parts of the fishing exam.
*   **Reference:** It acts as a reference for regulations, biological facts, and technical equipment specifications.
*   **Format:** All content is in standard Markdown, readable in any text editor or rendered via GitHub/Markdown viewers.

# Technical Details
*   **IDE Configuration:** Includes a basic Eclipse `.project` file, allowing the folder to be imported as a generic project in Eclipse-based IDEs.
